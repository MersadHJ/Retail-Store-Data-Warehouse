# Retail-Store-Data-Warehouse

## Project description
A retail store sells small quantities of products to the public. This store generally buys products from suppliers in large quantities and sells them to customers at a fixed price. Retail businesses include large chain stores or individual stores. The store should keep track of the products to be ordered from the suppliers. The store must place orders with suppliers based on product categories. Customers buy products from the store based on their needs. The store wants to create a database that effectively helps track the data of an entity.

## The reason for the need for a data warehouse for the selected topic
Because our store has many branches across the country, and to analyze data and adopt sales strategies and store policies, we need a comprehensive and unique source to access the data that We are involved in these decisions.
